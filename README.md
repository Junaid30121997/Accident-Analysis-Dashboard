# Accident Analysis Dashboard | Data-Driven Insights Using Excel

An interactive Excel dashboard analyzing 648K+ accident records to uncover patterns across road type, weather, time of day, and location. The project demonstrates how raw data can be turned into actionable insights for safety and infrastructure planning.

The dashboard aims to analyze and understand accident patterns, helping stakeholders identify critical safety factors and high-risk zones.

## Key Insights
- Single Carriageways recorded the highest accident rates → infrastructure improvement needed.
- Daylight accidents (471K) were significantly higher than nighttime accidents.
- 66% of accidents occurred on dry roads → driver behavior is a major factor.
- Urban areas contributed nearly 60% of total casualties → high traffic volume risk zones.

## Tools & Techniques
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers)
- Data cleaning and modeling using structured tables
- Interactive dashboards with dynamic filters
- Visual storytelling through clean and intuitive design
